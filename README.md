- [Oracle DevLive Level Up March 2023](https://developer.oracle.com/community/events/devlive-level-up-march-2023.html)

  Oracle is launching a new **FREE** hybrid event series...*Oracle DevLive: Level Up*. This event allows local folks to attend in-person or allows anyone to watch the live stream online.

  The week of March 20th will be the first instance of this event series with the goal to role out additional events in different geographies (more on this in the future). The event calendar and content is the following (when registering, you'll be able to pick the day of your choice or multiple days):

  - March 20: Cloud Native & AI Day
  - March 21: Java Developer Day
  - March 22: Data Strategies Day
  - March 23: MySQL Day
  
  > Location: Oracle Conference Center, 350 Oracle Pkwy, Redwood City, CA 94065

  **The Java Developer Day on March 21st will celebrate the Java 20 release scheduled to GA on that day**, as well as cover additional topics such as tooling & troubleshooting techniques, support for emerging frameworks, security enhancements in Java, JavaFX updates, participation in the OpenJDK project & Java community, and more. This day will be comprised of an opening keynote, 15 sessions and 3 hands-on labs (note that the labs will only be accessible by in-person attendees). Our plan is to record all content and then make it available for on-demand streaming on the official Java YouTube page.

  If you're local to the San Francisco Bay Area, we'd love to see you in-person! We'll offer coffee continuously throughout the day, a fully catered lunch, and in the evening on March 21st after the event is over, we're holding an evening reception (with drinks and snacks)...The reception offers you a chance to mingle and connect w/each other, the speakers and other Java developers from Oracle.
